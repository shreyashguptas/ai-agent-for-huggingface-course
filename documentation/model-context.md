# Model Context
----

- Make sure when you are giving me fixed code that you give me the entire updated code for that specific step in my jupyter notebook.
- The code needs to look at the other steps around it and make sure that it works well with them.
- So a change in the code for lets say Step 5 would mean that you give me the entire step 5 code again but with the fix that we are making so I can easily copy paste the changes.
